# Useful Commands!

I'm making a list of useful shortcuts and commands that I've picked up while learning programming. Please feel free to edit the html and css files here.

### -- Add a new keyboard shortcut

To add a new keyboard shortcut, make a new &lt;li&gt; tag.  That should have two &lt;div&gt; tags inside, the first one contain the shortcut, and the second one will contain a description of what it does.
  
To make a word look like a key, put a &lt;span&gt; tag around it.

### -- css

Feel free to edit the css file and change the colours or fonts etc
